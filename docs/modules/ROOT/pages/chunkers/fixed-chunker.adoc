= Fixed Character Chunker
:page-layout: article

== Overview

The Fixed Character Chunker is a basic text processing technique where text is divided into fixed-size chunks of characters. While simple, it serves as an excellent starting point to understand text splitting fundamentals.

== Installation

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.jchunk</groupId>
    <artifactId>jchunk-fixed</artifactId>
    <version>${jchunk.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

[source,groovy]
----
implementation group: 'io.jchunk', name: 'jchunk-fixed', version: "${JCHUNK_VERSION}"
----

== Configuration

[source,java]
----
// using default config
FixedChunker chunker = new FixedChunker();

// with custom config
Config config = Config.builder()
        .chunkSize(10)
        .chunkOverlap(0)
        .delimiter(";")
        .trimWhitespace(true)
        .keepDelimter(Delimiter.START)
        .build();

FixedChunker chunker = new FixedChunker(config);
----

=== Configuration Options

[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|===
| Option | Description | Default

| `chunkSize`
| Maximum number of characters per chunk.
Defines the "target size" of each piece. If a single segment is longer than this, it may exceed the limit.
| `1000`

| `chunkOverlap`
| Number of characters to overlap between consecutive chunks.
Useful for preserving context across chunk boundaries.
| `100`

| `delimiter`
| Regex string used to split text before forming chunks.
Common values: `" "` for spaces, `"\\n"` for newlines, `""` for character-level.
| `" "` (space)

| `trimWhitespace`
| Whether to trim leading/trailing whitespace from each chunk.
| `true`

| `keepDelimiter`
| Controls how delimiters are kept in chunks:
- `NONE`: remove
- `START`: keep at start
- `END`: keep at end
| `NONE`
|===

== Examples

=== Basic Chunking

Chunk size of 10 and no overlap (0)

[source,java]
----
Config config = Config.builder()
        .chunkSize(10)
        .chunkOverlap(0)
        .build();
FixedChunker chunker = new FixedChunker(config);
String text = "This is an example of character splitting.";

List<Chunk> chunks = chunker.split(text);

// Result: ["This is an", "example of", "character", "splitting."]
----

=== With Overlap

Adding 4 characters of overlap and a custom blank delimiter

[source,java]
----
Config config = Config.builder()
                       .chunkSize(35)
                       .chunkOverlap(4)
                       .delimiter("")
                       .build();
FixedChunker chunker = new FixedChunker(config);
String text = "This is the text I would like to chunk up. It is the example text for this exercise";
List<Chunk> chunks = chunker.split(text);

// Result: ["This is the text I would like to ch", "o chunk up. It is the example text", "ext for this exercise"]

== Pros and Cons

=== Pros
* Easy to implement and understand
* Predictable chunk sizes
* Fast processing

=== Cons
* Doesn't consider text structure or context
* May split words inappropriately
* Overlap creates duplicate data
