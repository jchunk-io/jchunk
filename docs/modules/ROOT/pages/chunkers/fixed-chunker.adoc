= Fixed Character Chunker
:page-layout: article

== Overview

The Fixed Character Chunker is a basic text processing technique where text is divided into fixed-size chunks of characters. While simple, it serves as an excellent starting point to understand text splitting fundamentals.

== Configuration

[source,java]
----
// using default config
FixedChunker chunker = new FixedChunker();

// with custom config
Config config = Config.builder()
        .chunkSize(10)
        .chunkOverlap(0)
        .delimiter(";")
        .trimWhitespace(true)
        .keepDelimter(Delimiter.START)
        .build();

FixedChunker chunker = new FixedChunker(config);
----

== Examples

=== Basic Chunking

Chunk size of 10 and no overlap (0)

[source,java]
----
Config config = Config.builder()
        .chunkSize(10)
        .chunkOverlap(0)
        .build();
FixedChunker chunker = new FixedChunker(config);
String text = "This is an example of character splitting.";

List<Chunk> chunks = chunker.split(text);

// Result: ["This is an", "example of", "character", "splitting."]
----

=== With Overlap

Adding 4 characters of overlap and a custom blank delimiter

[source,java]
----
Config config = Config.builder()
                       .chunkSize(35)
                       .chunkOverlap(4)
                       .delimiter("")
                       .build();
FixedChunker chunker = new FixedChunker(config);
String text = "This is the text I would like to chunk up. It is the example text for this exercise";
List<Chunk> chunks = chunker.split(text);

// Result: ["This is the text I would like to ch", "o chunk up. It is the example text", "ext for this exercise"]
----

== Pros and Cons

=== Pros
* Easy to implement and understand
* Predictable chunk sizes
* Fast processing

=== Cons
* Doesn't consider text structure or context
* May split words inappropriately
* Overlap creates duplicate data
